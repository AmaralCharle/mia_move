# Mia Move Hub - Project Scaffold

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold created from the uploaded file `mia.txt` (original file citation: fileciteturn1file0).

What I generated:
- `package.json` (Vite + React + Firebase dependency)
- `index.html`
- `src/main.jsx` (entry)
- `src/App.jsx` (your uploaded code placed here)
- `README.md` (this file)

How to run locally (basic):
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended).
2. In project root run: `npm install`
3. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Open the printed URL (usually http://localhost:5173)

Important notes & caveats:
- I placed your uploaded `mia.txt` content into `src/App.jsx` without major refactors. The original file contains several incomplete fragments and a few likely syntax errors (e.g. stray dots like `.{` or `.doc.data()` fragments and some templating placeholders). You may need to fix those to make the app compile.
- The UI uses Tailwind CSS classes in many components. Tailwind is NOT configured here — you can either add Tailwind or keep the classes (they'll be plain HTML classes if Tailwind isn't installed).
- Firebase config is expected to be provided at runtime via environment or embedding `__firebase_config` and `__app_id` as global variables. The app includes runtime guards for missing config.
- I did NOT modify your original code content except to wrap it as `src/App.jsx`. If you'd like, I can attempt to fix syntax issues and split components into files in a follow-up message.
